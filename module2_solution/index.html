                    The Ethiopian calendar has twelve months, all thirty days long, and five or six epagomenal days, which form a thirteenth month.[3][4]<br>
                    The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Geʽez. <br>
                    A sixth epagomenal day is added every four years, without exception, on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the corresponding Julian leap day.<br>
                    Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian calendar year, 1 Mäskäräm, for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September (Gregorian). <br>
                    It falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year, however. Ethiopian calendar is 7 years behind Gregorian calendar. Now they are in 2018.

                    Eating raw meat is a traditional practice in Ethiopia, particularly associated with celebratory occasions and communal gatherings.<br>
                    The most common form is Kitfo, a dish originating from the Gurage people, made from minced raw beef marinated in mitmita (a spicy chili powder blend) and niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter).<br>
                    Another popular dish is Tere Siga, which translates to "raw meat" in Amharic and consists of strips of raw beef, typically served with injera (Ethiopian flatbread), mitmita, awaze (a chili paste), or senafich (a mustard sauce).<br>
                    The practice is not exclusive to the Amhara ethnic group; it is also common among the Gurage, Welayita, and other ethnicities throughout the country

                    Ethiopian coffee is a cornerstone of national identity, deeply woven into the social, economic, and spiritual fabric of daily life.<br>
                    More than just a beverage, it is a symbol of hospitality, community, and tradition, central to celebrations, rituals, and everyday interactions.<br> 
                    The elaborate coffee ceremony, a ritualistic process involving roasting, grinding, and brewing in a jebena pot, serves as a powerful expression of unity and respect, with each of the three rounds—abol, tona, and bereka—carrying symbolic meaning.<br>
                    The coffee ceremony is a social and spiritual event that can take several hours, involving roasting green beans over an open flame, grinding them with a mortar and pestle, and brewing the coffee in a special clay pot called a jebena
